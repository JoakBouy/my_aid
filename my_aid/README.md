# Project Description

## Problem statement

Ineffective communication and coordination among healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers often result in care delays, misunderstandings, and a decline in healthcare quality, particularly impacting traveling study students. These obstacles shows the necessity for a robust healthcare application that improves communication, streamlines coordination, and empowers individuals to manage their health proactively.

## Our solution

My Aid App is a mobile application that helps ALU students in different hubs, be it in Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia find healthcare easily, with an internal database system that organizes and facilitates easier access and communication. Our team, "Group 18", has been tasked with creating a Mobile application design and its integration.

The platform will be a comprehensive and user-friendly tool, allowing students to access healthcare resources, book appointments, receive health-related information, and connect with qualified medical professionals in a new country, focusing on promoting students' well-being and addressing their healthcare needs efficiently.
