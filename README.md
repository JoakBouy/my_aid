# Project Description

## Problem statement

Ineffective communication and coordination among healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers often result in care delays, misunderstandings, and a decline in healthcare quality, particularly impacting traveling study students. These obstacles shows the necessity for a robust healthcare application that improves communication, streamlines coordination, and empowers individuals to manage their health proactively.
